                Happy valentine's day baby! Sa lahat ng panahong nakilala kita, hindi talaga sumagi kahit isang beses man lang 
                sa isipan ko na dadating ang araw na magiging "valentine" kita.
                Lalong lalo na ang maging girlfriend ka. I never really thought na a day like this would come. 
                But enough of that. Since today is about love, I'll tell you everything that I love about you. 
                PERO! Don't ever think na if mawala to, my love will also fade away. I'll be sad that's true,
                pero I will love you pa rin. First of all, I love how gentle you are like nung una kitang nakita. 
                It was so nice lang cos ikaw gid ang nag initiate para magkalapit pa talaga tayo. I love the way you hold my hand. 
                I love the way you're not embarassed to hold me in public and kiss me. 
                I love the way you're not nandidiri knowing I have eczema. 
                I love how you kiss it sometimes.
                I love the way you kiss me. I love the way you make that face when you kiss me. I love how you smile. 
                I love the way I feel you make a smile minsan while we're kissing. I love your facial expressions.
                I love how your face looks when I'm rage baiting you. I love your inis face, your gigil face, 
                your buong face gid. I love how you always remind me to drink water.
                I love how your face looks like pag kakasagot ko pa lang or kakasagot mo pa lang sa call.
                I love how you're randomly dancing or doing some moves sa call. I love it when you laugh kasi narealize 
                mo how silly you are.
                I love how focused you are right now.
                AHAHAHA for context, you are studying right now and you just told me facts about Africa. I love it when
                you tell me random things or talk about the things that you're most passionate about.
                I love it when you kiss me on camera. I love your eyes light up when I call you 
                baby sa call. I love it when your face gets so near sa screen mo minsan. I love how stubborn you are.
                I love how adik you are sa ML. And the way you get frustrated when ilang beses ka na namatay. I love how you
                always sakay to me. I love it when you're excited. I love it when you giggle. I hate it minsan when I'm literally
                having my most malas day and then you just laugh. But then it makes me feel better because you're laughing 
                and you're Ava Solis and I didn't know na possible pala na makasama kita on my best days, my worst, and my every day.
                I love how you tell me to do a food review when I'm eating something new or from a new kainan. 
                I love the way you almost always offer to pay my fud pero like stop gud!
                I really just love everything about you. I love you so much. I am so thankful that you are here. I am
                so thankful na sa lahat ng tao sa mundo, ako yung nakakaranas ng pagmamahal mo. I don't believe much in
                past lives, pero if I had one I knew I did something good to deserve you. Again, happy valentine's day to my
                forever valentine. Next time we'll celebrate this together and I'll have real flowers by then. I love you, 
                my baby.
